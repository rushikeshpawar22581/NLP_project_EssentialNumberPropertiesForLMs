Abstract:
Language Models have achieved impressive feats in Natural Language Processing, excelling at tasks like Text Generation, Machine Translation, Question Answering and Text Summarization. However, NLP systems rarely give special considerations to numbers. They are treated just like any other text tokens, but there is a fundamental difference between words/letters and numbers. This results in a relatively poor  numerical ability compared to linguistic proficiency.
In this project, we come up with a set of properties that LMs should know about numbers, and we build tests to check how well numeracy is captured by current state-of-the-art models. We experiment with GPT 3.5 Turbo, Gemini 1.0 pro and Llama 2 (quantized) and compare their performace on these tests. The code and additional plots are available at \url{https://github.com/rushikeshpawar22581/NLP_project_EssentialNumberPropertiesForLMs}
